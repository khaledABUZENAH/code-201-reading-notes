# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

# HTML5 Layout
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elemets on the page, but this method was kinda complicated, so they startd using the new HTMLS elements that provide a clearer code compared to the old method. HTML5 elements help to describe the stucture of web pages so the majority of the websites started using HTML5.

## There are several HTML5 elements, such as:
* section
* hgroup
* figure and figcaption
* div
* aside

### and I will clarify two of them:

* #### aside:
is has two functions depinding whether is is inside **<article>** or not:
1.  inside: should contain stuff that are related to the article but not important.
2. outside: a container for content that is ralated to the entire page, such as links to other sections or search box.

* #### hgroup: 
To group together a set of one or more h1 to h6 elements.

## ***extra information that you should know: ***
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
**<!-- and -->** markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

# The ABC of programming

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming and they are three sections:

1. **What is a script and how do I create one ?**

  script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. It's like a manual er a recibe that you follow to make or cook something, and the browser may use different parts of the script depinding on how the user interacts with the web page.


   To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.


  * ***DEFINE THE GOAL***
  * ***DESIGN THE SCRIPT***
  * ***CODE EACH STEP***
  

2. **How do computers fit in with the world around them?**

Computers create models of  the world using data, these models use objects to represent physical things, objectts can have:

* properties that tell us about the object
* methods that perform the task using the properties of that object
* events which are triggered when the user interacts with the computers

web browsers use the HTML to create a model of the web page, and to make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browsers's model of the web page.


3. **How do I write a script for a web page?**


* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file. 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
